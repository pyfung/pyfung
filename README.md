Most of the repositories here are the coursework that I designed over the years.

Since the students have posted them on various cheating websites anyway, I thought I may as well post them myself. Along with some commentaries and occasionally solutions. And a lot of absurd cheating attempts: they are so stupid, they should be made public for everyone to enjoy.
